          <p class="g-body paragraph">  
  Every year, the Department of Education releases university-specific data comparing student debt levels to first-year earnings in an effort to analyze the relative profitability of undergraduate degrees. For the first time, following a 2019 <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-devos-delivers-promise-expand-college-scorecard-provide-meaningful-information-students-education-options-and-outcomes">executive order</a> from the Donald Trump administration, the data now provides comparisons between each program of study offered by an individual institution.
</p>
        
    
      
          <p class="g-body paragraph">  
  With this data, Spectator conducted an analysis of the profitability of undergraduate and certain graduate degrees from Columbia in comparison to those of peer institutions. The data is based on university records of federal financial aid released to the DOE; it measures averages for students who graduated in 2015 and 2016.
</p>
        
    
      
          <p class="g-body paragraph">  
  While the debt and earnings levels of students across Columbia are overall line with national averages, Spectator’s analysis notably demonstrates that Columbia’s undergraduate and graduate art degrees are significantly less profitable than those of its peers. Specifically, degree earners in those programs are likely to accumulate much more debt than those in peer institutions despite earning an income that is on average the same. Even within the University, those who earned their degrees in visual arts, dance, theatre arts, and creative writing are the only Columbia alumni that can expect more debt than earnings in their first year after graduation.
</p>
        
    
      
          <p class="g-body paragraph">  
  Students in a number of graduate programs in engineering—such as civil engineering and information sciences—are also much more likely to incur debt than students at peer programs, though differences are not nearly as noticeable as those in visual programs.
</p>
        
    
      
          <p class="g-body paragraph">  
  In specific areas, degree earners from the University can also expect higher income than earners at peer institutions. Students in Business School programs see significantly higher earnings in their first year after matriculation than students in peer programs at institutions such as the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

          <p class="g-body paragraph">  
  In 2018, 52 out of the 54 visual arts students in the School of the Arts <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2018/04/30/with-decrepit-facilities-and-missing-faculty-mfa-visual-arts-students-demand-tuition-refund/">demanded a full tuition refund</a> for the academic year, citing decrepit facilities as evidence that they did not receive the education they were promised.
</p>
        
    
      
          <p class="g-body paragraph">  
  Though no conclusion specific to the faults of Columbia’s program can be drawn from the data, the dissatisfaction of students points to a trend in which master’s students in creative arts fields like film and writing accumulate much more debt at Columbia than at peer institutions, but do not earn significantly more than their peers.

  When comparing the financial well-being of master’s and bachelor’s students, while the former have  increased earnings, the latter take on significantly less debt. In the <a href="https://provost.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/Institutional%20Research/Statistical%20Abstract/cc_ug_degrees_by_program_of_study.pdf">2019 class</a>, undergraduates majoring in film, drama, and visual arts made up 3.8 percent of the graduating population.
